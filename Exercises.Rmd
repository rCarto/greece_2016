# Import Data in R
The first step is to import some data in R. 

## Import Statistical Data 
- Import data on countries (/data/world.csv)  

## Import Geographical Data
- Import the world countries base-map. Which package is needed to do so?


# Get information on the dataset
- How many countries are documented in this file ?
- How many variables describe the countries ?
- Which country has the greatest share of urban population ? You will have to create a variable (share of urban population) and find a way to get its maximum value (see `?order` or `?which.max` functions)

# Manipulate the base map

- Display a map of the world (change countries colors, boundaries, background...)
- Change the projection of the map (see the `?spTransform` function from the `sp` package).

# Thematic Mapping
- Create a map of the countries population with a full layout (north arrow, legend, title...) (see the  `?cartography` package)
- Create a map of the countries urbanization.

# Distance calculations
- Which are the countries the more away from each other ? (see `spDists`, `which`...)
- Which are the countries the closest from each other ? 

# Geoprocessing
- Import the layer of Souli localities and the Corine Land cover layer of Souli.
- Plot a map with each dot colored with the land use it lays on. (see `over` from `sp` package)  
- Use detailed names in the legend (see the clclegend.csv file and `?merge`)
