# Import Data in R
The first step is to import some data in R. 

## Import Statistical Data 
- Import data on countries (/data/world.csv)  

## Import Geographical Data
- Import the world countries basemap. Which package is needed to do so?

# Get information on the dataset
- How many countries are documented in this file ?
- How many variables describe the countries ?
- Which country has the greatest share of urban population ? You will have to create a variable (share of urban population) and find a way to get its maximum value (see `?order` or `?which.max` functions)

# Manipulate the base map

- Display a map of the world (colored countries, boundaries)
- Change the projection of the map (see the `?spTransform` function from the `sp` package).

# Thematic Mapping
- Create a map of the countries population with a full layout (north arrow, legend, title...) (see `?cartography`)
- Create a map of the countries urbanization with a full layout (north arrow, legend, title...) (see `?cartography`)
